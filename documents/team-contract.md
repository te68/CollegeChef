# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name.

    - Artemis

2. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Work together to finish all the milestones on time with quality work
    - Develop our project using user centered design and following the best practices of UI textbook
    - Create a functional high fidelity prototype based on the results from the planning and design process
    - Develop our own existing coding, designing, and user research skills
    - Set our own milestones and deliverables to stay on track, and finish all delegated tasks on time
    - Ask each other or the TAs or Kyle for help if stuck on completing tasks. Do not wait until last possible moment to get help

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - Respect and value each other's work and opinions
    - Every team member must contribute to the work equally
    - Maintain effective communication: respond or react to group message within 24 hours
        - Communicate if there are any issues
        - Let the team know ASAP if there are any conflicts in finishing work on time
    - Attend and actively participate in all group meetings
    - Be flexible and willing to do the work necessary for the project to stay on track
    - Do not be late in completing assigned tasks. Also, there is a general expectation to not complete work at the last minute so there is time to review and look for any mistakes.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - Meeting during class studio time and/or on campus (reserve rooms for team meetings)
        - If we are not able to meet in person, we will conduct our meetings through zoom
    - **Weekly** team meeting/check-in (flexible depending on amount of tasks, approaching deadlines, conflicts, etc)
    - Communicate via iMessage group chat
        - Members should communicate whenever they make any changes in git
        - Message whenever it is necessary, whether it's for questions, concerns, or other general comments
        - If a member is unable to make the deadline, message the group chat as early as possible -- at least 48 hours before said deadline
    - If something comes up the day of the meeting, the member should notify the group chat as soon as possible to reschedule
        - If iMessage is inaccessible, the member must reach out through email

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

    - We will all take part in doing these roles:
    - UX Designer: Analyze the findings of the interviews and create personas based on it. Come up with key insights (maybe using affinity diagraming techniques) and create preliminary sketches, wireframes, and mock-ups on the potential solutions.
    - UX Researcher: Investigate the problem space, understand the users, create interview scripts and protocols, run contextual interviews
    - Programmer: Code the PWA based on the research that has previously been done by designers and researchers and implement
    all the functionalities of the app.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - We will hold ourselves accountable by making sure each team member has completed their assigned tasks during meetings
    - If a team member has not been contributing equally, we will ask questions to understand if they are having any issues that we can help with
    - If a team member is not able to contribute much on a certain task/milestone, they must contribute in other ways or contribute more in other tasks
    - Missed deadlines will only be excused if the team member informs the team members ahead of time (at least 48 hours before). The team member provide a valid excuse for this request, such as unexpected personal circumstances. The extensions such as this will be allowed only once a month, after which the member will be penalized accordingly. 
    - If a team member does not have a valid excuse for not completing a task on time, then we will refer to this contract to show them what they agreed to do and a minor punishment might occur, such as informing Kyle or TA about the situation. Then we will move forward and ensure the team member prioritizes finishing the work on time. 
    - If a team member misses deadlines more than once (without a valid excuse), we will contact a TA to help solve the issue and will have the appropriate punishment for the member. The punishment for the slacking member will be to have a sentence saying 'Team Artemis have a slacking member.' on our table for 2 classes, with the arrow point to the team member that missed many deadlines. 

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - If there is any disagreement, members should communicate with the group rather than keeping it to themselves.
    - When there is a disagreement, we will first discuss the matter as a group to try and find a resolution. If necessary, we will vote on how to proceed and the majority vote wins (3-1)
    - If the vote results in a tie, we will contact a TA to see what they think is the best idea to move forward with
    - While there is a conflict taking place, every team member must be respectful of other's opinions at all times

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - If there is a recurring problem or conflict within the group, we will refer to this contract to restate the ground rules we established
    - If there are any changes to roles, workflow, and rules during the project, we will discuss the changes on iMessage or Zoom
        - After reaching consensus, modify the appropriate section or adjust roles accordingly
    - We will also refer to this contract after every milestone to make sure the contract is working and whether it needs changes 


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    - Make sure you are at least having some fun during the project
    - If the project is a great success, we will pick an activity to celebrate
