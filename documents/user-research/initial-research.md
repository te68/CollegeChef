# Initial Interview Notes

### These are the notes we collected by informally by interviewing students to help determine our user group

#### student athlete
- athlete usually doesn’t cook much because he doesn’t have enough time. When he does however, he tries something healthy and simple (which in most cases doesn’t require online assistance).
  - Such meals include pastas, rice with chicken and vegetables, etc.
  - He follows many insta food pages and tries new food when at home, but thats only when his mom cooks for him
#### an international student from Serbia
- other friend tries to search for some non-us food online and get different ideas. He would have some ideas before going to do groceries and then would buy ingredients that may help him.
- He uses Pinterest/ instagram as well for the ideas in general, something that isn’t typical for US and maybe closer to his eating style, and he checks to see if he has ingredients
  - if he doesn’t he cooks something more simple; beans, mashed potatoes and pasta/ rice with some meat that doesn’t require assistance
#### a roommate in Collegetown
-	cooks the same thing because it takes too long to find new recipes and that means they have go get groceries specially for the purpose of cooking that dish
- only cooks dishes that doesn’t require much ingredients because not enough time
- tries to eat more consciously (as in eat less meat etc) but is difficult because they don’t	- tries to eat healthier but is difficult because healthier food often requires more thought and longer time
  - ends up eating whatever they can make with what is in the fridge because they usually buy the same ingredients when they go grocery shopping
- can’t go grocery shopping often due to limited budget and no time
#### a roommate at Westbourne (off-campus)
- cooks for herself
- doesn’t really know how to cook, says her roommate says her meats are somewhat undercooked but she doesn’t know when to cook them until in the first place
- Takes recipes from YouTube videos but it usually doesn't turn out tasting as good, but it's edible
- Likes Asian foods and mostly cooks Asian foods because it's familiar
- Feels like she’s cooking wrong every time but doesn't really care because in the end she's consuming something
- Says all her food is completely bland because they doesn’t know how much seasoning/what seasoning
- Gets take out sometimes but tries to avoid it because it's expensive and they're on a tight budget
#### college friend who lives off campus
- cooks for herself but doesn’t really know what to cook esp for meat, kind of throws soy sauce and oyster sauce and call it a day bc it’s staple - it also works for her so she’s ok with it
- Meat is difficult so she buys frozen packaged, spam, or the Korean bbq types - fast
- If have time, opens Pinterest and sees what she has in her fridge then types “(ingredient) recipe” and follows that but only ones where she has ingredients for (or ommitable ingredients) but takes a lot of time finding something she likes with all the ingredients she has
- Nowadays no time so just orders a lof of take out or make ramen noodle, throws in washed veggies and frozen meat, doesn’t want to follow recipe bc no time
- Doesn’t like it when there’s a life story with the recipe
- She loves breakfast so she tries harder for breakfast and likes to go all out, but doesn't follow a recipe
#### random college student
- cooks for herself
- wants to cook well, so calls up her mom and her mom tells her steps to cook a certain dish and used to do this every time she cooks
- doesn’t want to cook/make anything until she knows exactly how to do it
- but lately just half remembers all the recipes her mom told her and throws things together or eat frozen foods/instant foods because she gets cravings and doesn't want to spend a lot of time
- sometimes splits her lunch in half and eats the rest for dinner so she doesn't have to cook and save money
- doesn't get takeout only in emergencies because it is expensive
