Interview: 
1. Introduction
Hello! We are students in Info 4340 and are looking to develop an app for those who frequently order takeout instead of cooking. The interview will consist of few questions regarding your experience ordering food and preparing meals. This interview will last approximately 30 minutes. Please know that you do not have to answer all the questions and feel free to stop us if you feel uncomfortable at any point. All information is confidential and will not be shared with anyone else. Before we get started, are you okay with this interview being recorded? 

### Background
- 21 year old female, senior at the College of Engineering at Cornell.
- No dietary restrictions
- Lives with 3 other housemates, shares kitchen, fridge, (sometimes) food.

### Core Questions
__Eating schedule__
- Eats about twice a day (brunch and dinner). Eats brunch usually around 12-2PM and dinner can range anytime from 6PM - 12AM 
    - for brunch, usually gets something on campus either Terrace or Macs
    - for dinner, if she has enough time she sometimes cooks, but most times gets takeout or delivery from somewhere in collegetown.
- When she does cook, she cooks something that can be made very quickly with very limited ingredients

__Ordering food__
- last time ordering food: yesterday (Friday, October 22) for PokeLava. 
- Decided to order from pokelava because she was busy and didn't have much time to wait for food (PokeLava was the quickest option since they prepare it right in front of you)
- Also was the quickest and convenient location since she lives right next to the restaurant
- Decided to eat PokeLava because compared to other options in collegetown, it is still relatively healthy and she can get lots of vegetables and protein
- Overall satisfied with the meal that she had. It's a quick and safe choice to make since she knows it's not going to take long and it's going to be delicious
- Sometimes alternates between other restaurants in collegetown like Kokos, Gangnam Station, Oishii Bowl, and etc but PokeLava is almost like her "go to" because it is the closest. 
- Usually prefers going in person for pickup because it's relatively quicker than getting delivered especially on apps like UberEats and GrubHub
    
__Cooking food__
- The most recent time she cooked was today (Saturday, October 23)
- Cooked salmon rice (but a quicker and easier version of the salmon rice recipe)
- Decided to eat it because she was very hungry and didn't have many ingredients left in the apartment. Wanted something that can be prepared quickly with few ingredients
- Overall satisfied with the dish, but not as good as making it the way that the original recipe states (which requires seasoning and grilling salmon, unlike the way she made it, which was with canned salmon)
- Makes it frequently because it's one of the few receipes she knows and it's also very quick
- Learned how to make it from her roommate who learned it from TikTok
- Is not a good cook and is clumsy, so she doesn't like cooking often

- Got the ingredients to make this dish from Trader Joes
    - Didn't have time to go grocery shopping herself so she asked her housemate to get it for her
    - Chose this method because her housemate likes going to Trader Joes and she just happened to go recently
    - Also decided on canned salmon because it's cheaper than buying real salmon and getting a lot of other ingredients because as a college student, she is on a limited budget

__Finding new recipes__
- Finds new recipes by either asking her family, friends, or just searching it up on google or youtube. 
- Looks for recipes that don't require much time to make because she is busy most of the times. Also wants something that doesn't require too many ingredients to be used. Tries to look for something thats a bit healthier out of the options
- Last time she used a recipe was to get rid of tofu and egg that she had in her fridge
    - Found the recipe by looking up "dishes using tofu and egg"
    - Just skimmed through some of the options that google displays at the time, clicked on a few to see if she already has the ingredients, check the amount of time it takes to make it, and etc
    - After looking through a couple, just decided on one that looked the best and took the least amount of time
    - Recipe was somewhat useful, as she was able to make a dish using ingredients that she had left, but not quite as much as she wanted to because it still required ingredients that she did not have
    - Usually ends up altering the recipe to fit what she has
- but mentioned that she's often too lazy to look through all the recipes so she either clicks on the one that's at the most top or she just gives up and just stirfry everything or just order food instead

- Generally, when cooking she just kind of "wings" everything in terms of how much to put in certain seasoning and etc
- Just tries to think about how the food tasted when she ordered out or when her friends or family made it and just tries to replicate it
    - trial and error

- Overall, eats out more than cooking food. She wants to cook more so that she can save money but doesn't have much time to go grocery shopping and cook whenever she is hungry
- Convenience outweighs other factors, as she is very busy a lot of the times
- Trying new recipes also in general take even longer time than cooking something that you already know, because ideally, you have to have the exact ingredients and follow the steps
- Has been cooking her salmon rice recipe a bit more often nowadays because it takes so short to make it -> if she knew how to make other recipes that took as short, she would make it but she just doesnt know
- Only spends more time cooking a more "legit dish" is when she is eating with others/sharing food
