- Background
  - 21 year old female student at Cornell University in her senior year, ILR major
  - Lives off campus in an apartment with two other people, the three of them share a kitchen and refrigerator
  - No dietary restrictions
- Eating habits
  - Eats three meals a day
    - brunch @ 11am a few hours after waking up
    - lunch/dinner at 4:00pm
    - Dinner at 8:00pm with snacks in between
  - Doesn't eat after waking up because will get hungry too fast afterward, doesn't want to have to eat more food
  - Can predict when she is going to be hungry
    - Usually every 2 or 3 hours, either will have a snack or a meal
- Ordering food
  - Doesn't like ordering through an app or through a website or online
    - main problem with that is that every restaurant uses a different platform so she would have to sign up for all of these accounts
      - doesn't want to input credit card, etc.
  - Likes to call restaurants
  - If ordering online, Google the restaurant and try to order through the restaurants platform rather than a third-party platform.
  - Sometimes order for convenience, low price, and fast because does not have time to cook or does not want to cook
  - Sometimes will be craving a specific food and will order something that is more expensive or takes longer
- Recent experience: Oishi bowl online order
  - ordered online through the company's website
    - very easy to do once website was found on Google
  - they texted and emailed when it was ready in 10-15 minutes
  - walked to restaurant to pick it up and walked back home in 10 minutes
  - choose to do a pickup because it was a short distance
  - choose Oishi bowl because it's one of the cheaper and faster restaurants in college town
    - "at that moment I was just looking for cheap and fast and filling"
    - Got home from work at 8, normally when she returns at this time she does not want to cook
  - very satisfied with the experience as a whole
    - didn't have to wait at all, system to order was simple
    - however doesn't order from there often because she prefers the taste of other places
- Cooking
  - Does not cook that often, doesn't like to cook often
  - The problem in college is that she doesn't have all the ingredients that she would want to have, and does not want to purchase those regularly.
  - "Since I'm only cooking for myself, then I don't want to buy a lot of niche things because I'm not going to use them."
    - Implying there are foods she likes to eat but doesn;t think it would make sense to buy all the ingredients because she wouldn't cook it enough
    - Example: if she wants pasta, she wants fresh basil with it, the basic in her fridge would not be fresh, so it's easier to get it from a restaurant
- Recent experience: preparing a meal
  - Brunch at around noon
  - some toast with eggs, three eggs
    - salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, maybe, maybe cayenne garlic powder parsley.
    - "I just throw in general spices. I just throw them in whatever sounds like it would go"
    - went by intuition, learned from experience
  - plum and a smoothie smoothie with spinach, yogurt, banana, frozen fruit and milk
  - drink smoothies most mornings just because she doesn't get the chance to eat that many fruits and vegetables
    - doesn't want to worry about nutrition for dinner
    - learned how to make the smoothie from former roommate
      - She tried it and liked it so she learned how to make it
      - she likes to know what something tastes like before making it herself, this prevents cooking something and finding out she doesn't like it, a waste of time and effort
      - cooking or ordering takeout with unfamiliar foods is always a risk
  - Eggs for protein because she wanted some nutrients to fill her up for class
  - Need to eat some carbs in the morning or else she doesn't feel full
  - main trouble with cooking this meal is the time it takes
    - that is the main problem with cooking in general
    - dishes and preparation take too long
    - doesn't want to set aside hours for meal preparation
- Food
  - is very particular about food
    - Would like to have a balanced meal
    - something savory, carbs, protein, vegetables, fruit
    - Satisfied with meals if it's more comprehensive
    - If ordering out, not looking specifically for nutritious meals
      - "It's mostly just about being full"
  - When cooking, have more control over what she is eating so it is easier to focus on nutrition and balanced meal versus ordering or going out has little control
    - doesn't not order vegetables when eating out
    - try to eat healthy prepared meals
- Getting ingredients experience
  - Went to Aldi, the ideal, quick, grocery shop
  - Drives there in her car, spends 20 minutes shopping
  - Likes how they don't have 20 different kinds of each product, limited selection makes it easier to pick ingredients
    - Overwhelmed by the options in Wegmans
  - Only difficulty is putting aside time to go
  - Doesn't pay attention to experience dates but does take some time to assess produce
  - Looks at the price but is not picky about small differences, she knows the whole grocery store is reasonable
  - organic vs. non organic doesn't affect decision
  - Chooses ingredients that she already has a plan for what she will do with them or ingredients that are very flexible
- Experience cooking from recipe
  - Don't really cook from recipes, only bake
    - Doesn't browse recipes
  - Baked banana bread because she had old bananas to get rid of
    - She will use a recipe if she has an ingredient she doesn't know what to do with
    - Did not have a recipe in her head for banana bread
    - Just selected one of the top results that had a picture that looked good
      - Looked more moist and bouncy that the other recipes
  - Looked for recipe without many ingredients
    - sometimes with baking, doesn't have all the materials needed for baking
  - Didn't read the instructions to carefully, has an idea of how to bake and doesn't think banana bread is a difficult dish
    - "I just throw everything in"
    - only pays attention to ratios of food
    - will sometimes not even set a timer
- Recipes
  - She would use recipes if she had more time to experiment and more ingredients and everything she needs
  - would use more recipes with a "full kitchen" with more supplies
  - mostly cooks from experience and food that she has eaten already
