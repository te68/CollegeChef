        - google how to bake a sweet potato
    - How did you find the recipe? Was it useful? Why was it useful or not?

    - What difficulties did you encounter?
        - He was estimating the time that it would take it to bake the sweet the potato and he wasn't right - they weren't cooked enough and he needed to bake them more
    - Why did you choose to use the recipe? What was the motivation for that?
        - he just used the first that popped up. It isn't complecated and he didn't need anything specifically, thus he just opened the first one. He just needed an info that isn't to hard to get and make
