## User Interview Notes: Participant 3

### Background
- Female college student at Washu, senior, psych major with JP minor
- No dietary restrictions
- Live off campus with 1 other person. Shared kitchen.

### Eating schedule
- Eat breakfast right away after waking up bc need energy to do stuff - often avocado toast. Always save time to make breakfast bc love it very much.
- Lunch after class around 11:10 - get something from campus
- Then for dinner if have part time job, then usually find something really quick on campus again. If no job, then go home. If roommate is home, then get takeout together. If not, then make instant ramen.
- If just her by herself, she just makes instant noodles. Sometimes skip dinner bc ate too much for lunch and haven't digested or not in mood, then would eat snack or banana or two tangerines.

### Ordering food
- Gets food online through Grubhub. Gets Grubhub+ from her school which is free delivery so its also convenient for her.
- Got food bc housemate was also home and it’s just what they do together. 
- The restaurant is right there and they prepare it really fast, don’t have to give drivers tips or anything like that, can just walk down, go across street and pick it up. 
- Got takeout Tuesday with her housemate. Ordered korean bbq bowl from a nearby korean place. Got half and half chicken and tofu. 
- Trying to consume less red meat. Bc feel like red meat is not as good as white meat and they like chicken and tofu.
- Read an article that healthier diets sort of omit red meat and shes trying to lose weight and eat more healthy. Also trying to cut down on rice.
- Pretty much only eats East asian food (Cn, Jp, Kr)
- Satisfied with takeout food, not picky eater.
- No difficulties ordering and getting food, extremely fast and convenient. Grubhub has "Order Again" feature
- Rotate between this place (BOBQ) and a Chinese place (Corner 17) which they eat more often at and dine in. Or poke. 
- Have tried other places (with friends or special occasion) but stick with this bc she is used to eating East Asian food.
- Stated it was $13 and thinking back on it that's pretty expensive, often said to herself that she should stop getting takeout so often.

### Cooking
- Most recently was last night bc it was just her in the house. Was about to eat instant ramen, but saw her cabbage was about to go bad so she prepared it.
    - Later on she mentioned she had finished all her exams and essays so she had time. Implies time is not a strict factor to why she eats instant ramen.
- Made okonomiyaki bc had thought about it last week which is why she got the ingredients for it last weekend when grocery shopping
- Chose okonomiyaki bc had it already in her mind before and she likes it. She already got the flour from amazon a while ago. 
- She was satisfied with the meal. She used to make the sauce herself but now she just buys the sauce. 
- Is precise with the measurements. 
- There were difficulties bc it requires effort and gets very messy and she uses many bowls so she has to wash a lot which she finds annoying.
- Willing to put in the effort to make non-instant fodos if she's not pressed for time and it's not 5hrs. 
- Does not make this food frequently - first time this semester.
- Learned by following instructions at back of okonomiyaki flour package. This time she followed the recipe again though because it's been a while. Also sort of knows the ingredients needed beforehand. 
- She got all ingredients from grocery story 2 blocks away. Didn't take long bc she knew where everything was. Goes to this store because decently priced and very close, convenient.
### Finding recipes
- Uses Chinese pinterest. If there's something she feels like eating and she has the ingredient in the fridge like diced chicken, searches up "diced chicken recipe" and looks through photos until she finds something interesting. Clicks into the post, looks at the ingredients and instructions to gauge if she can make it.
- For jp food, she uses one specific online cookbook (Just One Cookbook)
    - Goes in with a recipe already in mind and doesn't explore other recipes. A lot of JP recipes comes from her understanding of JP culture and her being in JP club.
- Doesn't have trouble following a recipe
    - Just assembles all the ingredients but doesn't measure them out beforehand. Then forgets how much she needs so shes constantly scrolling back up which is annoying. 
- Chooses recipes that combines her favorite foods together, like riceballs or sandwiches, korean/jp salad.

### Finding a recipe walkthrough
 - Went into google with a dish in mind and typed in "sukiyaki just one cookbook" and clicks first link
 - Looks through the recipe, scrolling past the life story at the beginning, and checks the ingredients. 
 - Then scrolls down to the steps to look at the pictures and if it's a lot of trouble.
 - Decides it's not too much trouble so she says it's an option.
